# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Projects-using-Python---FreeCodeCamp
 
The repository is a collection of 6 sub-projects on datasets and problemsets from freecodecamp.org. The repository is just my approach on the datasets and problemsets; also excluding the unit tests and other modules provided by freecodecamp.

A brief description of the dataset and problemsets are:

i) Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator: A simple function to calculate summary statistics of a list of numbers using the Numpy library.
ii) Demographic Data Analyzer: Basic inferences from the demographic dataset extracted from the 1994 Census database.
iii) Medical Data Visualizer: Visualizing a medical dataset with body information of patients along with basic analytical operations on the dataset such as data cleaning, data normalization, deriving features and so on.
iv) Page View Time Series Visualizer: Visualizing time series data from freecodecamp's website view dataset and performing basic analytical operations such as data cleaning, reformatting datasets and so on.
v) Sea Level Predictor: A simple predictor function using linear regression on CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level dataset and predicting the sealevel for 2050 based on the whole data and current trends. 
vi) Sales Data Analysis: Visualizing a sales dataset using different forms of visualization along with performing basic analytical operations using the Pandas library.
